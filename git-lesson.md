## How to create a branch from the main branch in github
### First I rececived a github link for Sahnun inviting me on a project to collaborate as
a programmer.The first thing I did was to click on the  github link that will take me straight to the github repository
Sahnun created.At the home tag of the github account I will see the name of the repository that was created by Sahnun
"Nova_Web_Dev_Practice". At the bottom of that repository name I will see "main/master" branch.Click on the arrow that is
opposite main/master branch. If you click on that arrow a search box will display with the following instruction, "find or
create a branch. In this option type the name of your branch you think is ok for you. After typing press enter on your keyboard
it will create copy of the main/master branch. Which will contain a copy of the main/master branch. After creating this
branch click the code bottom at the far first right corner of your repository this option will help you clone the repository
and give you the ability of make changes in your own of branch without affecting the main branch. "To be continue later"
